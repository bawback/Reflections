When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Using a Remote Repository is crucial when multiple people are working on a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because it is neccessary to review the changes first.
    
   
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are like clones except that you can do it on GitHub and not localy. Clones are like copying a branch. branches
    can only be made in a local or online repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
